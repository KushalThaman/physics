title: What will be big in 2060

# The Situation

Every generation has one big thing that they can focus on. One big invention, a discovery, or extreme progress in one field. The 1900s generation had the wars and the subsequent defence and military progress that came with it. They also had the first computers. The 1950s generation had the invention of the personal computer. The 2000s generation had the invention of high-speed internet and personal computing really took off with devices such as the apple watch, phones, laptops etc.

But now what?

If one studies history, and looks closely at the market itself, you can sort of realise that there is this extended limbo phase after huge progress. For example, after the industrial revolution and the widespread adoption of machines and the such, there was a huge limbo phase, where there wasn't anything new being discovered or invented. The same happened with military tech after the world wars, a lack of need didn't push much innovation. The same is being reflected here

I feel that personal computing has begun to stagnate. The phones being sold now have no new features as such, just extra cameras and gimmicks. The laptops and computers come with faster speeds and more RAM, but nothing close to the level of innovation that existed some time ago, such as the invention of the iphone, the macbook, the kindle, etc. This is that limbo phase, where development and innovation has come to a standstill.

# My Predictions

Unless quantum computing breaks through and finds real, everyday applications in the next 20 years, we will not see further development or progress in this sector. I do not foresee this happening.

## Initial Thoughts

In this case, I look to something new, something that was kicked off by a recent implementation by none other than Elon Musk. Starlink.

> Starlink is now delivering initial beta service both domestically and internationally, and will continue expansion to near global coverage of the populated world in 2021.
During beta, users can expect to see data speeds vary from 50Mb/s to 150Mb/s and latency from 20ms to 40ms in most locations over the next several months as we enhance the Starlink system. There will also be brief periods of no connectivity at all.
As we launch more satellites, install more ground stations and improve our networking software, data speed, latency and uptime will improve dramatically.

This absolutely blew me away. Being born in 2003, I have seen such problems with the laying of real technology, physical wires and such for the internet. I had to sit through men spend days dragging wires, burying optic cables and testing signal connectivity at multiple spots along the wire to figure out problems. 

Starlink DECIMATES this, and offers something that no technology as of today has offered so far. This makes a lot of sense regarding the commercial space applications of today

## Conclusion

I had always viewed spacetech as a novelty. Something that's cool to research and develop, but not really something that has widespread applications. However, I immediately understood the flaws in my thinking when I watched the original Ashton Kutcher jobs movie. This was the same thing. Everyone thought that personal computers were a hobbyist thing, that hobbyist used and messed around with, with no realworld applications, and they were all left in the dust when the revolution really took off.

This also got me interested in the direction Computer Science is heading in, and brings me back to a story that my uncle once told me about an early adopter. 

### The story

The early adopter was a friend of my Uncle's. 40 years ago, he studied Computational Biology. A field that was non existent at the time, especially because there were no computers powerful enough. But now that there are, he is an expert, and running his own company with little to no competition. I predict that in 5 years, this becomes a big thing, and you will see a universities, people, parents and the general public, pushing people to get educated in this new *hot* field. By that time, it is already too late. 

The Starlink application made it dawn upon me that commercial space applications are the next big thing. This is why, I will be investing my time, money and effort into space technology. We have not yet made a significant breakthrough in this aspect except the small breakthroughs by Musk in terms of reusable rockets.

I'm currently thinking of working on these throughout college, and studying a large amount of Physics in college to understand the nitty grittys of this application. I could also go another way and study Finance and Economics, but that just seems like a wasted application of my skills as a citizen of the new world. 

I also watched a James Jani video some time ago, where he describes the way to impact and be rewarded. Its by solving a problem for which the market rewards you. If space tech gets big in the future, it will certainly have its fair share of problems, and those problems will need solutions. Right now, it is hard to solve these problems due to the large amount of capital needed to make it work, however, as more progress is made, I expect this barrier of entry to break. 

See you in the future. Here's to hoping that space technology becomes the next big thing.
