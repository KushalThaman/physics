I came across a post recently, criticising Steve Jobs for who he was. A vindicative jerk. This is common knowledge, corroborated by coworkers, board members, employees and even his own family. His daughter even wrote a book about it, elaborating on some of his human flaws.

This was particularly interesting to me as I had read more reports about other influential titans behaving the same way, notably, Elon Musk, and it got me thinking. Was this necessary to bring about true change in this world? 

While I can't comment on this directly, what I do know is that when you want to change something, or get work done, people view you in a negative light. I've had dozens of experiences in the past where I have seen people criticise me for being arrogant or demanding when I was trying to get work done. Looking back, these are some of the greatest successes that I've personally had as a team leader as well.

Jobs was a visionary, who truly changed personal computing for good, and for the better, if I may say so myself. He was a product genius, someone who knows how *exactly* to design, ship and sell something. However, he was also human, as human as the rest of us, with the same flaws.

I believe at this point, after reaching his level of success, it doesn't matter. He changed lives, and that would have been much harder if not impossible to do if he was nice and lenient. He got what he want, his vision, without regard for other people's feelings. This is again similar to how capitalism works, the employees are paid and compensated for their efforts, whereas the one running the business and bearing the risk has their visions fulfilled.

This is not to say that being nice accomplishes nothing. Sometimes it is essential to be nice as it helps us in the long run. 

Was Steve Jobs a Jerk? Yes.

Was he a bad person? Maybe.

But I can argue that to mankind and society as a whole, he was a lot more valuable than any ineffective, nice person could be. If given the choice between being nice and being effective, I think I know what I will constantly pick over the others, because I want to impact change in society, not just be known as the nice guy.

Nice guys always finish last.
