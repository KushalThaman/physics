title: My Profile for the US and Canadian Application Process
description: A brief of the profile that helped me make it into some of the most
  prestigious US and Canadian Universities
---
I understand that some of you may have found me while going through the college admissions process, so I thought I'd outline what exactly my profile was like, to give you a better idea. 

I would also like to make it known that this is in no way a definitive profile or a requirement that is needed to get into colleges in the United States.

# Stats:

**SAT:** 1580/1600 (800 EBRW, 780 Math) â†’ AIR 2 in the September 2020 SAT examinations.

**SAT II:** 800 Physics, 800 Math 2

**AP:**

5: AP Calc BC, AP Physics Mechanics, AP Physics E&M, AP Comp Sci A

3: AP Chem

**TOEFL:** 120/120

Note: The online mode of AP 2020 might have contributed to a low score in Chem, but I was not particularly bothered as I was majoring in CS, something that does not involve Chem

**GPA:**

9th grade: 94.2%

10th grade: 95.6%

11th grade: 87%

12th grade: 86%

Was in the top 5% throughout.

# ECs

I think this was the weakest link in my profile, as I did not have many ECs, and to top it off, the ones I had weren't great

- My company [1sigmoid](https://1sigmoid.ml/), where we help smaller businesses and NGOs reach the younger generation through data-analysis, advertising, customized APIs and so on.
- An internship at Cisco, fully funded by Cisco India, where we developed [Athena](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lmn6MzDVQsc) (a web app to help students find events, competitions, classes and friends based on their interests rather than their social circle), the best project to ever come out of the internship. Pretty selective, used state of the art technology and handled cloud deployments using AWS, Docker, Kubernetees, backend tech using NodeJS, frontend using Angular 8, load balancing with NGINX etc
- A fellowship at [YLAC](https://theylacproject.com/counter-speech-fellowship/), fully funded by FaceBook, where I was one of 25 selected from over 2.5k applicants, and met prominent Indian politicians, activists, CEOs, and impacted change through novel ways of advocacy. I was particularly concentrated in LGBTQ+ rights.
- My contributions on [GitHub](https://github.com/sumukshashidhar); around 4k+ code commits in the past year, put me in the top 1%. I worked on my own projects and contributed to some bigger projects such as Deno, Dortania, the GhostCMS, etc
- Some volunteering to help students with virtual classes during the pandemic, where I set up donated laptops and tablets for teachers to host online sessions through Zoom and Google Meet.
- Research with an amazing professor at a prominent institute regarding the limbic brain and causes for procrastination.
- Some competitive programming awards at Google Hashcode, LeetCode Biweekly, CodeChef, Codeforces. Sub 300 nationally, but not too great.
- Some awards at local MUNs.
- I managed technology and editorials for my school magazine
- Some quizzing awards at TCSITWiz, Times NIE, KQA etc
- ML and Data Science Online Coursework during the pandemic. Certification in ML from Stanford with a 4.0 GPA.
- Some chess I played for the school team.

As you can see, very weak extracurriculars in general, which kinda tanked my application.

# LoRs

I've read them, and they were pretty good

# Essays

They were great too, maybe I'll read them out sometime on my YouTube channel
